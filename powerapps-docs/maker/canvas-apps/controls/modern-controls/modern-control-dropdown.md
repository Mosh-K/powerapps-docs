# Dropdown modern control in canvas apps

Let users pick a single value from a collapsible list.

## Description

The **Dropdown** modern control presents a list of choices in a compact, collapsible format. Users select one item and the list collapses back to a single line. Use it to save screen space when a list has many options, for required fields with a fixed set of choices, and for forms where compactness matters. Key properties for this control are **Items**, **Default**, **ValidationState**, and **OnChange**.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes the updated Dropdown modern control. For information about what changed from the previous version, see [Recent updates](#recent-updates).

On desktop, the updated control opens a **Fluent-themed flyout** that matches the app's visual theme. The previous version opened the browser's HTML `<select>` element, which couldn't be themed. 

## General

**Items** – The source of data that contains the items that appear in the control. Accepts a table, a collection, or an inline array (for example, `["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"]`).

**ItemDisplayText** – A Power Fx formula evaluated for each item in **Items** to determine the text shown in the list. Defaults to `ThisItem.Value` for string arrays and `ThisItem.Value1` for table data sources. Change this when your data source has a specific column to display (for example, `ThisItem.Name`).

**Default** – The initial selected value before the user makes a change. Set this to a value that exists in **Items** (for example, `="Option A"`). Leave blank for no default selection.

**AccessibleLabel** – Label read by screen readers. Describe the purpose of the dropdown (for example, `"Select a country"`).

**Visible** – Whether the control appears or is hidden.

## Behavior

**OnChange** – Actions to perform when the user changes the selection. Use `Self.Selected.Value` to read the current selected item.

**Required** – Whether the user must make a selection. When **true**, an indicator appears beside the dropdown. Default is **false**.

**DisplayMode** – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**).

**ValidationState** – Applies validation styling to the control. Accepts `ValidationState` enum values:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ValidationState.None` | No validation styling. Default. |
| `ValidationState.Error` | Highlights the control border in red to indicate an error. |

## Size and position

**[X](../properties-size-location.md)** – Distance between the left edge of the control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Y](../properties-size-location.md)** – Distance between the top edge of the control and the top edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**Width** – Distance between the control's left and right edges. Default is **320**.

**Height** – Distance between the control's top and bottom edges. Default is **32**.

**PaddingTop** – Distance between the control content and the top edge of the control.

**PaddingBottom** – Distance between the control content and the bottom edge of the control.

**PaddingLeft** – Distance between the control content and the left edge of the control.

**PaddingRight** – Distance between the control content and the right edge of the control.

## Style and theme

**Appearance** – The visual style of the dropdown field. Accepts `Appearance` enum values:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Appearance.FilledDarker` | Filled with a slightly darker background. Default. |
| `Appearance.Filled` | Filled with a standard background. |
| `Appearance.Outline` | Outlined border with a transparent background. |

**BasePaletteColor** – The base color used by the theme to generate the control's color palette. Use this to apply a different theme color to the control.

**Font** – The font family used for the dropdown text.

**Size** – The font size of the dropdown text, in points. Default is **14**.

**Color** – The color of the dropdown text.

**FontWeight** – The weight (thickness) of the dropdown text. Accepts `FontWeight` enum values: `FontWeight.Bold`, `FontWeight.Semibold`, `FontWeight.Normal` (default), `FontWeight.Lighter`.

**Italic** – Whether the dropdown text appears in italic style.

**Underline** – Whether a line appears under the dropdown text.

**Strikethrough** – Whether a line appears through the middle of the dropdown text.

**Fill** – The background fill color of the control.

**BorderColor** – The color of the control's border.

**BorderStyle** – The style of the control's border. Accepts `BorderStyle` enum values: `BorderStyle.Solid`, `BorderStyle.Dashed`, `BorderStyle.Dotted`, or `BorderStyle.None`.

**BorderThickness** – The thickness of the control's border in pixels.

**RadiusTopLeft** – The corner radius for the top-left corner of the control.

**RadiusTopRight** – The corner radius for the top-right corner of the control.

**RadiusBottomLeft** – The corner radius for the bottom-left corner of the control.

**RadiusBottomRight** – The corner radius for the bottom-right corner of the control.

## Additional properties

**ContentLanguage** – The display language for the control content, if different from the app language.

## Output properties

**Selected** – The currently selected item, returned as a record. For a string array, use `Dropdown1.Selected.Value` to read the selected text. For a table data source, use `Dropdown1.Selected.<ColumnName>`.

## Example

The following YAML example shows a required country dropdown with error state validation:

```yaml
- CountryDropdown_3:
    Control: ModernDropdown@1.0.0
    Properties:
      AccessibleLabel: ="Select your country"
      ItemDisplayText: =ThisItem.Value
      Items: =["Australia", "Canada", "United Kingdom", "United States"]
      Required: =true
      ValidationState: =If(IsBlank(CountryDropdown_3.Selected.Value), ValidationState.Error, ValidationState.None)
      Width: =240   
```

## Recent updates

The updated version of the **Dropdown** modern control includes the following improvements and behavior changes.

### Property renames

| Previous property | New property | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DefaultSelectedItems` | `Default` | The initial selection is now set via `Default`. Any formula referencing `Dropdown1.DefaultSelectedItems` must change to `Dropdown1.Default`. |
| `FontSize` | `Size` | Renamed to match other modern controls. Default changed from **0** (inherits from theme) to **14**. |
| `BorderRadius` | `RadiusTopLeft`, `RadiusTopRight`, `RadiusBottomLeft`, `RadiusBottomRight` | Split into four independent corner radius properties for greater styling flexibility. |

### Enum format changes

| Property | Previous value | New value |
|---|---|---|
| `Appearance` | `"FilledDarker"` | `Appearance.FilledDarker` |
| `Appearance` | `"Filled"` | `Appearance.Filled` |
| `Appearance` | `"Outline"` | `Appearance.Outline` |
| `ValidationState` | `"None"` | `ValidationState.None` |
| `ValidationState` | `"Error"` | `ValidationState.Error` |

### Bug fixes and improvements

- **Fluent-themed flyout**: On desktop, the dropdown list now opens as a Fluent-themed flyout that matches the app's visual design. The previous version used the browser's HTML `<select>` element, which couldn't be themed. On mobile, the device-native picker is used by both versions and is unchanged.
- **ItemDisplayText**: New property that controls which field of a data source record to show in the list. For string arrays, this defaults automatically. For table data sources, set this to the column you want to display (for example, `ThisItem.Name`).
- **Full font control**: New `Font`, `Color`, `FontWeight`, `Italic`, `Underline`, and `Strikethrough` properties give full text styling control, consistent with other modern controls.
- **Updated enums**: `Appearance` and `ValidationState` now use typed Power Fx enums, improving IntelliSense and reducing formula errors.
